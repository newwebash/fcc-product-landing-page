# fcc-product-landing-page
Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp Product Landing Page project!

![Site screenshot](_static/images/fcc-product-landing-page-above-fold-16Nov20.PNG)

This website is the landing page for a fictional yoga studio
called MyFav Yoga. Since I'm always in search of the perfect
yoga studio, I figured I'd create a landing page for one!

## See the site live

You can see the site live on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/NewWebAsh/full/GRqeRbb)

## See the project description

This site is based on a coding challenge on FreeCodeCamp. See the full
[challenge description here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page).

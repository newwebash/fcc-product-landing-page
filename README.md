# fcc-product-landing-page
Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp Product Landing Page project!

This website is the landing page for a fictional yoga studio
called MyFav Yoga. Since I'm always in search of the perfect
yoga studio, I figured I'd create a landing page for one!

It's a responsive site for three different screen sizes.

## Larger screens

## Smaller screens

This site is based on a coding challenge on FreeCodeCamp. See the full
